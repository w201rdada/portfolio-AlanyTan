## increasing relationship crisis in digital age.

While divorce rate has been steadily dropping in the past couple of decades, the drop was mainly associated with a bigger drop in marriage rate.   However, less marriage does not mean there is less relationship, and less divorce rate does not mean less break ups. [@bgsu_divorce_2016]
It has been industry consensus that (romantic) relationship breakdown is only second to loss of family member (more on this later) in its emotional traumatic effect to the victim(s).  

Human therapists, coaches can be very expensive and also limited in their experience relevant to the victim (previous cases they've seen/treated). The traumatic impact on the therapists themselves are also limiting the amount of help they are able to offer everyday. 
The availability of good and relevant guidance is a big challenge in this area, combined with privacy concerns, lead to most people going through this rely on their family, if not themselves only. 


## A data science approach to human relationship.
The advancement of technology are commonly associated with undesirable shift in social interaction and structure, what often overlooked was the fact that ability to address such challenges are also presented with the technology advancement.
While AI and data science have the tendency of treating people more "like a denominator", it also gave us the ability to offer help in unprecedented ways.

One less intuitive area was relationship management.  While most news headlines are negative, like "smartphones are ruining your relationship", there are areas where we see opportunities technology can help human relationships.  These includes areas from relationship risk prediction, inspirational content generation, para legal, financial planning help, and AI therapists.  

We will focus on 2 of these possibilities: Relationship risk prediction, and AI therapist. 

There are some existing literature with time-series data for Facial Affect Coding, can predict divorce up to 90% of accuracy [@john_gottman_gottman_2015].  This approach can be combined with more innovative data processing that became newly available. For example, from analyzing couple's Facebook actions and interactions, we can determine people's personality with higher accuracy than traditional questionnaire  [@youyou_computer-based_2015].  Adding on top of that, personality can be used to predict romantic relationship [@noam_shpencer_how_2016].  Building on top of these ideas, we can leverage similar concept, using people's online behavior regarding relationship management, for example for a particular user, how many "divorce" related documents they are reading .vs. how many "back together" documents, how long they stay on different documents, NLP on their forum/chat stream for emotion analysis, and the type of service their inquiry, can be used to create a predictive model and used to predict "future of relationship".

Another area of innovation is AI therapist.  Back in 1964, one of the very first "chat-bot", ELIZA was built to be a non-directional psychotherapist (some say it's a parody).  The result was actually pretty amazing, lots of people believed in the therapeutic power of ELIZA which pretty much just re-phrase any questions and ask it back at the user.  As the AI technology advances, chat-bot is already at an unprecedented level. Considering the traditional Turing test requires the computer to fool 70% of the human judges that it can imitate human intelligence, we are within striking distance when it comes to specific field intelligent chat-bot that provides therapeutic values.  The AI therapist will be built on existing chat-bot platforms with special content of therapeutic session as training data.  In a sense of natural language processing and response generating form, it will be first used in education settings, for therapist training.  This provides a two way communication process where the AI therapist will offer examples of scenarios for human therapists in training, while human therapists will also catch and correct obvious errors that are generated in the AI chat-bot responses. 
The second phase would be a limited roll out, where free, or nearly free AI therapist will start to offer treatment sessions to light cases, and recommend more senior human therapist in case of severe cases.  As more users using it, more data will be collected, combining with our user behavior tracking and prediction model, we would be able to identify the effectiveness of the AI therapist (i.e. romantic status update, reading more possitive articles instead of "divorce" topics, etc) 

## An analysis of our initial results.
We have done some market research and focus group study.  We found that a lot of the studies in romantic relationship management are available, some of them even proposed certain "prediction" models.  However, most of these models require significant amount of human expert intervention, which makes large scale implementation cost-prehibitive.  Our plan is to leverage existing studies, and technologies, combine it with data science approach (ie. data collection from modern social media, news feeds, etc, and novel strategies, i.e. offering free gifts for people's anniversaries, or special dates - so that we get indirect information regarding their relationship).  We believe there are a lot of actual work can (and need to) be done in this area.  We hope everyone can leave a happier life.
