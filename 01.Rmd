## increasing relationship crisis in digital age.

While divorce rate has been steadily dropping in the past couple of decades, the drop was mainly associated with a bigger drop in marriage rate.   However, no marriage does not mean there is no relationship, and less divorce rate does not mean less break ups. 
It has been industry concensus that (romantic) relationship breakdown is only second to loss of family member (more on this later) in its emotional tramatic effect to the victim(s).  

Human therapists, coaching can be very expensive and also limited in their experince relevant to the victim (previous cases they've seen/treated). The truamtic impact on the therapists themselves are also limiting the amount of help they are able to offer everyday. 
The availability of good and relevent guidance is a big challenge in this area, to the point most people going through this rely on their family, if not themselves only. 

## A data science approach to human relationship.
The advancement of technology are commonly associated with undesirable shift in social interaction and structure, what often overlooked was the fact that ability to address such challenges are also presented with an opportunity to grow by the technology advancement.
While AI and data science have the tendency of treating people more "like a denominator", it also gave us the ability to offer help in unprecedented ways.

With modern technology, we see 3 areas of services could be practically offered to relationship management.  

First, relationship risk prediction.  While we would not just tell someone "your chance of relationship failure is 79%, we can actually use big data and data science to predict the risk and offer tailored recommendation of services, articles to read, self-education, or guided self-improvement. 

Second, content generation.  Most of the inspirational quote, or poems are very encouraging, however, for people in dark mood, "quantity" is important for them to feel they are not alone.  But privacy concerns also means people in relationship crisis are less likely to have meaningful human thought partners to give them such inspiration or encouragement.  So AI generated content to encourage people to deal with the issues they face is a key value proposition (think about it as a more sophisticated chat bot that always churn out positive encouraging contents)

Third, assisted AI para legal.  When it comes to relationship crisis, legal terms come in to play a big role - knowing the legal hoops ahead of time would significantly affect people's preparation and ability to deal with the fall out.  As AI in paralegal has been tested, it would be a nature extension to develop paralegal in marriage/divorce law to lower the cost of legal hoops for majority of the people involved. 

These areas can leverage relatively tested technology and with big data, could yield value for human augmented emotional health. 


## An analysis of our initial results.
We have done some market research and focus group study.  We found that relationship management can be a hundred-billion-dollar market globally.   However, lots of existing services are too expansive for some most-in-need demographic (i.e. single mother with children).  The cost analysis of existing services reveals the main cost is the human therapist cost - qualified therapists are rare and they need years of training to be able to provide individual analysis and treatment.  So the need for affordable service would be best satisfied with an AI based approach.
