## The home security monitoring bussiness is long over due for a disruption

Lots of people have or had Home Security motioning service(s).  However, it's an industry that has generated more frustrations than satisfactions.  One user summarized it well "why do I pay hundredreds of dollars a year for something to listening on my private life and only works if I didnt' forget to turn it on?"

While most of such monitoring services had sensors installed at customer's homes, majority of them are still rely on analog human based sound monitoring as its core service offering.  While this might reduce false alarms, the cost (each human can only monitor certain number of homes, hence the cost can't get lower than certain point), privacy concerns (I have had friends who worked in this industry, and boy, does he have stories to tell), and the limited functionality is unbelievably medieval. 

Some gadget vendors started to sell some "digital" monitoring tools, but instead of using data science to reduce human intervention, these gadgets tend to "let you monitor your own home".

## How can Data Science reinvent this industry

It is not hard to imagine that the home monitoring sensors can be digital sensors, as a matter of fact, lots of them are these days. 

Each sensor would be a feature of a data-set, so one of the easiest thing we could have done is by consolidating such sensor readings across large amount of homes, we can use Data Science to find patterns, and may even predict break-ins, or flooding based on sensor reading, time of day (or week, month), geolocation info, and weather forecast, etc.  While many gadget vendors are selling internet based monitoring systems, with fancy features like video feeds, they omitted Data Science potential of having lots of homes connected, and pull data together to be used by a Data Science approach to monitor, even predict incidents. 

Next, there are existing technologies that are able to have always-on sound monitoring capability, think of Amazon Echo, or the glass break monitor many home monitoring system offer.  We can extend this technology to cover a much wider range of events - in addition to glass break, we shall be able to capture door opening, footsteps (and even tell if this is a family member or a stranger), flood, fire, and one more valuable example is for a senior who lives home alone, if she falls, the AI powered sound monitor should be able to recognize that and call for help even if the senior herself can't push a button.  So leveraging Data  Science in sound recognition to modernize this sensor and how data is used, is a big value added revolution in this industry. 

Last, but not least, replacing human monitors who listens on your nightly conversations, is a great protection of your privacy.  The voice recognition technology has reached to a point where it surpassed human in dictation recognition rate.  This means talking to a machine, one has better chance of being transcript ed correctly than talking to a human.  When it comes to limited context - in this situation, security related topics, the recognition rate can be even higher.  So people can sleep better at night knowing no one around the corner is listening to their snoring at night.

## Benefiting everyone

One feature of this long overdue revolution is that it will benefit everyone - the customer will be able to safe on monthly fee, yet receive much more value added service, which means more families will be able to afford such services, think about high crime neighborhoods where many families may have lower-income; the monitoring companies will increase their reach, improve their accuracy, and even some predictive ability to increase responsiveness, and reduce false alarm; the employees of the monitoring companies will stop working night-shifts which known to be a health concern, actually a lot of the employment of the monitoring companies would shift to Data Science, sensor engineer type, high paid jobs. 
So the long over due revolution in this industry is a great opportunity for everyone, and all the technology needed for such revolution is already available.  The real innovative part, is the Data Science models that will be needed to change the monitoring from a "sound" driven approach to a data driven approach.
