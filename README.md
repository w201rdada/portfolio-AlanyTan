# Alan's Portfolio

Using W201 RDADA template, here is my student portfolio. The portfolio will be the place for me to complete my individual assignments 1-3, and will also be where I provide peer review to other students in the class for participation credit. Beyond course requirements though, let me fork of this repo be a place to stretch my data science imagination. Whatever ideas brought me to data science and MIDS to begin with, there is no time like the present to give a voice to those thoughts and to share them with others.

Our work gets better only through an endless push-pull cycle of publishing a version of an idea and then capturing the critical reactions of audiences. That criticism is a gift that can be fed into the next revision. We will practice workflows that will enable this kind of productive give-and-take with your audience.


## Submitting my work

Your products for RDADA will be the four plain text source files all written in Markdown:

* `index.Rmd`, your landing page with abstracts and a welcome video, and
* `01.Rmd`, `02.Rmd`, and `03.Rmd`, your three concepts.

At the end of the term we will learn how to build those sources into websites or PDFs, but let's concentrate on having something to say first. When you pull the repo for the first time these files will be populated with some simple boilerplate and [hipster impsum](https://hipsum.co/) that you should replace with your own content, while still adhering to the basic beginning, middle, and end structure. Note that for each concept the header includes a title, a short slug for the title, and keywords.

To edit these files, you can:

* Edit them locally any way you like and submit directly by editing the files at https://github.com/w201rdada/portfolio-mygithubusername and then saving as a commit directly to the GitHub remote.
  + Recommended if you've never used `git`.
* Clone your repository locally, edit in your favorite text editor, and use a [basic git workflow](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) from your command line.
  + Recommended if you are comfortable with `git`.
* Use the free [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) IDE as an editor, which has some neat features to make life with RMarkdown more enjoyable (albeit more complicated since many more features will be visible to you).
  + Recommended if you are comfortable with `R`.

If you use your own editor, be sure to save in `utf-8`.
