<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The home security monitoring bussiness is long over due for a disruption</h2>
<p>Lots of people have or had Home Security motioning service(s). However, it’s an industry that has generated more frustrations than satisfactions. One user summarized it well “why do I pay hundreds of dollars a year for someone to listen in to my private life and only works if I didn’t’ forget to turn it on?”</p>
<p>In the age of Internet of Things, it’s ironic that most of such monitoring services had sensors installed at customer’s homes, majority of them are still mainly rely on human listening to analog sound streamed through phone-line or cell signal. While this might reduce false alarms, the cost (each human can only monitor certain number of homes, hence the cost can’t get lower than certain point), privacy concerns (I have had friends who worked in this industry, and boy, does he have stories to tell), and the limited functionality is unbelievably medieval.</p>
One of the biggest issues of this industry as it stands it amplifies inequality. Most of crime laden neighborhoods actually struggle to even put food on the table, so spare hundreds of dollars a year on “hiring someone to monitor your home” is just unaffordable. However, despite “barely anything to lose”, any financial lose to lower income families actually have a much bigger impact proportionally compare to more affluent families. And this create a barrier between affluent neighborhoods and more crime-affected neighborhoods, which in turn causes a vicious cycle. <!-- ...or include images directly from the web.

<p>Some gadget vendors started to sell some “digital” monitoring tools, but instead of using data science to reduce human intervention, these gadgets tend to “let you monitor your own home”. While it may be OK for someone who is able to attend video feeds on their phones 24*7, this kind of monitoring is much less feasible for working families who do not have the luxury of watching their own homes whenever their phone beeps.</p>
<p>So here come data science to solve a market issue and social issues at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-can-data-science-reinvent-this-industry" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> How can Data Science reinvent this industry</h2>
<p>It is not hard to imagine that the home monitoring sensors can be either replaced or retrofitted with digital sensors, as a matter of fact, lots of them are already digital these days. They collect data like door/window open (or even lock), smoke, CO level, flood, glass break (more on this one later), light, infra-red motion detection, some of them even have power, communication line fault detection.</p>
<p>Each sensor would collect a feature of a data-set, so one of the easiest thing we could have done is by consolidating such sensor readings across large amount of homes, we can use Data Science to find patterns, and may even predict break-ins, i.e. maybe based on location, weather, recent neighborhood incidents, and particular motion, sound pattern, we should be able to not only alert early, but also provide recommendations to home owners, or even law enforcement of which area to focus on (i.e. put more patrol units).</p>
<p>While many gadget vendors are selling internet based monitoring systems, with fancy features like video feeds, and motion detection, they omitted Data Science potential of having lots of homes connected (the value of community based security enhancements), and pull data together to be used by a Data Science approach to monitor, even predict incidents.</p>
<p>In addition, there are existing technologies that are able to have always-on sound monitoring capability, think of Amazon Echo, or the glass break monitor many home monitoring system offer. We can extend this technology to cover a much wider range of events - in addition to glass break, we shall be able to capture door opening, footsteps (and even tell if this is a family member or a stranger), flood, fire, and we can even combine this with infra-red motion sensors (or even video feeds) to get a very detailed examination of events that is under monitoring. One big benefit of using Data science to do this is privacy concerns, the level of detail that these technology can collect is paramount, to allow human (usually a stranger) to collect these rich information about our private home is worrisome. However, when we use Data Science to perform these monitoring, the privacy concern is much less dominant (we actually can combine blockchain technology to even record and control which human can view the collected data beyond our AI agents).</p>
<p>The voice recognition technology has reached to a point where it surpassed human in dictation recognition rate. This means talking to a machine, one has better chance of being transcribed correctly than talking to a human. When it comes to limited context - in this situation, security related topics, the recognition rate can be even higher. So people can sleep better at night knowing no one around the corner is listening to their snoring (or sleep-talked their password) on the other side of a monitoring phone line.</p>
<p>One more socially valuable example is for a senior who lives home alone, if she falls, the AI powered sound monitor should be able to recognize that sound and call for help even if the victim can’t push a button. So leveraging Data Science in sound recognition to modernize this sensor and how data is used, is a big value added revolution in this industry that not only benefit traditional home-monitoring users, but also have broad implications for additional services opportunities.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, replacing human monitors who perform these monitoring will significantly lower cost of these systems. This will lower the barrier of adopting such services. Unlike traditional monitoring where additional families signing up cost the monitoring company more human capital, Data Science based approach actual can benefit from more data available, hence it may even be desirable for monitoring companies to offer this service to lower-income neighborhood families free of charge, because the data collected would not cost the company much, but actually can help enhance ML training results.</p>
</div>
<div id="benefiting-everyone" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Benefiting everyone</h2>
<p>One feature of this long overdue revolution is that it will benefit everyone - the customer will be able to save on monthly fee, yet receive much more value added service, which means more families will be able to afford such services, think about high crime neighborhoods where many families may have lower-income; the monitoring companies will increase their reach, improve their accuracy, and even some predictive ability to increase responsiveness, and reduce false alarm; the employees of the monitoring companies will stop working night-shifts which known to be a health concern, actually a lot of the employment of the monitoring companies would shift to Data Science, sensor engineer type, high paid jobs. So the long over due revolution in this industry is a great opportunity for everyone, and all the technology needed for such revolution is already available. The real innovative part, is the Data Science models that will be needed to change the monitoring from a “sound” driven approach to a data driven approach.</p>
