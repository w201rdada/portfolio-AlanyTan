Using data to help people deal with most intimate emotional crisis. We know human relationship go through ups and downs and crisis. While “relationship counselling” exists, usually people would not explicitly seek such help, until they realize the seriousness of the crisis, which often means, it’s already too late. Casual “help”, like “talking to my confidant” are prone to echo chamber effect, instead of getting insights that one might omitted, many time, those unprofessional families and friends often offer either echo chamber feedback, or share their own life experience which rarely dealt same stakeholders and situations. What we propose is using machine learning approach to analyze user’s communication patterns (i.e. who they talk to most often, the sentiment in their communications with different people, type of articles they consume, etc), with such data, and combined with “target” information (if they go through divorce, for example, which we collect by the means of offering marriage counseling services), we will be able to predict relationship issues, even before they break out into crisis. While we might not be able to prevent all of the crisis from getting worth, the ability to predict such crisis usually have an out of proportion benefit to less privileged members of societies. Next, AI therapists will change the industry in two ways, first, thanks to its tireless ability to engage continuously, “treatment session” concepts will be replaced with “treatment” stream, it will be a 24*7 always available hotline (or hot chat) therapy stream. Secondly, it will build on top of previous studies in both AI and (more importantly) human’s response to AI interaction to provide help to people in particularly need - those people who might feel most lonely during a crisis where their previous closest person is their biggest source of agony. Abstract of my second cool idea For the home (or office) security monitoring industry, there has been a long over due AI-revolution. If one take a good look into this industry, they would notice it nearly begged for AI for many years. Not only most of these home monitoring systems install sensors, of which many are digital already, but also the recognition of break-in, fire, flood, etc, is pretty much a pattern recognition. So I propose apply Data Science and turn the home monitoring industry upside down. All sensor data will be considered as input features, and events (break-in, fire, etc) are targets. So the prediction model will be pretty classic machine learning problem. The advanced portion of this plan would include additional data, i.e. audio feeds and/or video/infrared feeds. Though such data, we can leverage data science to recognize patterns even before events happen. The additional social benefit is for example a senior who lives alone might fall and becomes unable to call for help. Such audio feed monitoring will be able to pick up such events. This will not only provide more people independence, but more importantly offer people better privacy (if you worked in home monitoring industry, you would know it’s not fun to listen in on people’s night talk). And the system will also get better by getting more data, so the quality of service will improve as number of users grow, and it will significantly lower cost, so make such service more affordable to particularly lower income/high crime neighborhood.

While divorce rate has been steadily dropping in the past couple of decades, the drop was mainly associated with a bigger drop in marriage rate. However, less marriage does not mean there are less relationships, and lower divorce rate does not mean less break ups. (bgsu 2016) Figure 1.1: Relationship breakdown is 2nd most traumatic emotional expereince Actually, it has been industry consensus that (romantic) relationship breakdown is only second to loss of family member (more on this later) in its emotional traumatic effect to the victim(s). So divorce reduction while making the the number less alarming, is one example of using data to hide the actual human emotional suffering. There have been human therapists, coaches, not only they are limited in their experience relevant to the victim (previous cases they’ve seen/treated) but also the traumatic impact on the therapists themselves limit the amount of help they are able to offer everyday. What’s more important is usually when people realize and make the effort to seek professional help, the problems are already too big to be ignored, which usually means much harder to fix by that time. The availability of good and relevant guidance, insights is a long known challenge in this area, combined with privacy concerns, lead to most people going through this rely on their family, friends, if not themselves only. 1.2 A data science approach to human relationship. The advancement of technology are commonly associated with undesirable shift in social interaction and structure, what often overlooked was the fact that ability to address such challenges are also presented with the technology advancement. While AI and data science have the tendency of treating people more “like a denominator”, it also gave us the ability to offer help in unprecedented ways. Take it technical, one of the most commonly cited problems of social interaction in digital age is that digital channel and contents replaced people’s nature communication. However, the opportunities associated with this “digital channel in between” was often looked upon as a drawback only, instead of being used for good - with more and more communication moving towards digital, we now have huge amount of data to process, lots of them might not be relevant or meaningful when they were “novelties” however, as they become ubiquitous, we can now use these data to help people by analyzing the data pattern and its correlation, we would be able to predict relationship future that human therapists need months if not years of relationship with patients to do. Figure 1.2: [When data science come to the rescue of human love relationship] While most news headlines are negative, like “smartphones are ruining your relationship”, such statements are actually predictions of people’s relationship future. We could have run much more serious data science study to support such notion, for example, would people who post, or consume more social media content during meal time (or late night) have high chances of changing their relationship status on social media? Will two accounts that are shown as in a relationship checked in to the same place together, their usage pattern can be correlated to predict their relationship future as well. Because people voluntarily provide their relationship status, the change of such status could be used as target of prediction. We will focus on 2 of these possibilities: Relationship risk prediction, and AI therapist. There are some existing literature with time-series data for Facial Affect Coding, can predict divorce up to 90% of accuracy (John Gottman 2015). Considering how This approach can be combined with more innovative data processing that became newly available. For example, from analyzing couple’s Facebook actions and interactions, we can determine people’s personality with higher accuracy than traditional questionnaire (Youyou, Kosinski, and Stillwell 2015). Adding on top of that, personality can be used to predict romantic relationship (Noam Shpencer 2016). Building on top of these ideas, we can leverage similar concept, using people’s online behavior regarding relationship management, for example for a particular user, how many “divorce” related documents they have read .vs. how many “back together” advice they went through, how long they stay on different articles, NLP on their forum/chat stream for emotion analysis, and the type of service their inquiry, can be used to create a predictive model and used to predict “future of relationship”. The second area of innovation is AI therapist. Back in 1964, one of the very first “chat-bot”, ELIZA was built to be a non-directional psychotherapist (some say it’s a parody). The result was actually pretty astonishing, lots of people believed in the therapeutic power of ELIZA which pretty much just re-phrased any questions and ask it back at the user based on some pre-determined grammar rules. While it was AI in its infancy, the more important revelation of ELIZA was human’s reaction to AI, or as broader sense human’s perception of intelligence including AI. As the AI technology advances, chat-bot is already at an unprecedented level. Considering the traditional Turing test requires the computer to fool 70% of the human judges that it can imitate human intellectual interrogation, we are within striking distance when it comes to specific field intelligent chat-bot that provides therapeutic values. The AI therapist will be built on existing chat-bot platforms with special content of therapeutic session as training data. In a sense of natural language processing and response generating form, it will be first used in education settings, for therapist training. This provides a two way communication process where the AI therapist will offer examples of scenarios for human therapists in training, while human therapists will also catch and correct obvious errors that are generated in the AI chat-bot responses. The second phase would be a limited roll out, where free, or nearly free AI therapist will start to offer treatment sessions (or in new therapeutic model – treatment stream, because AI does not have to time box helpful interactions because of money or hour limits) to light cases, and recommend more senior human therapist for severe cases. As more users using it, more data will be collected, combining with our user behavior tracking and prediction model, we would be able to identify the effectiveness of the AI therapist (i.e. romantic status update, reading more positive articles instead of “divorce” topics, etc) 1.3 An analysis of our initial research We have done some market research and focus group study. We found that a lot of the studies in romantic relationship management are available, some of them even proposed certain “prediction” models. However, most of these models require significant amount of human expert intervention, which makes large scale implementation cost-prohibitive. Our plan is to leverage existing studies, and technologies, combine it with data science approach (ie. data collection from modern social media, news feeds, etc, and novel strategies, i.e. offering free gifts for people’s anniversaries, or special dates - so that we get indirect information regarding their relationship). We believe there are a lot of actual work can (and need to) be done in this area. We hope everyone can leave a happier life. Bibliography "],

However, it’s an industry that has generated more frustrations than satisfactions. One user summarized it well “why do I pay hundreds of dollars a year for someone to listen in to my private life and only works if I didn’t’ forget to turn it on?” In the age of Internet of Things, it’s ironic that most of such monitoring services had sensors installed at customer’s homes, majority of them are still mainly rely on human listening to analog sound streamed through phone-line or cell signal. While this might reduce false alarms, the cost (each human can only monitor certain number of homes, hence the cost can’t get lower than certain point), privacy concerns (I have had friends who worked in this industry, and boy, does he have stories to tell), and the limited functionality is unbelievably medieval. One of the biggest issues of this industry as it stands it amplifies inequality. Most of crime laden neighborhoods actually struggle to even put food on the table, so spare hundreds of dollars a year on “hiring someone to monitor your home” is just unaffordable. However, despite “barely anything to lose”, any financial lose to lower income families actually have a much bigger impact proportionally compare to more affluent families. And this create a barrier between affluent neighborhoods and more crime-affected neighborhoods, which in turn causes a vicious cycle. (#fig:pic_old_monitoring)[Grandpa`s home monitoring - by Verizon] Some gadget vendors started to sell some “digital” monitoring tools, but instead of using data science to reduce human intervention, these gadgets tend to “let you monitor your own home”. While it may be OK for someone who is able to attend video feeds on their phones 24*7, this kind of monitoring is much less feasible for working families who do not have the luxury of watching their own homes whenever their phone beeps. So here come data science to solve a market issue and social issues at the same time. 2.2 How can Data Science reinvent this industry It is not hard to imagine that the home monitoring sensors can be either replaced or retrofitted with digital sensors, as a matter of fact, lots of them are already digital these days. They collect data like door/window open (or even lock), smoke, CO level, flood, glass break (more on this one later), light, infra-red motion detection, some of them even have power, communication line fault detection. Each sensor would collect a feature of a data-set, so one of the easiest thing we could have done is by consolidating such sensor readings across large amount of homes, we can use Data Science to find patterns, and may even predict break-ins, i.e. maybe based on location, weather, recent neighborhood incidents, and particular motion, sound pattern, we should be able to not only alert early, but also provide recommendations to home owners, or even law enforcement of which area to focus on (i.e. put more patrol units). While many gadget vendors are selling internet based monitoring systems, with fancy features like video feeds, and motion detection, they omitted Data Science potential of having lots of homes connected (the value of community based security enhancements), and pull data together to be used by a Data Science approach to monitor, even predict incidents. In addition, there are existing technologies that are able to have always-on sound monitoring capability, think of Amazon Echo, or the glass break monitor many home monitoring system offer. We can extend this technology to cover a much wider range of events - in addition to glass break, we shall be able to capture door opening, footsteps (and even tell if this is a family member or a stranger), flood, fire, and we can even combine this with infra-red motion sensors (or even video feeds) to get a very detailed examination of events that is under monitoring. One big benefit of using Data science to do this is privacy concerns, the level of detail that these technology can collect is paramount, to allow human (usually a stranger) to collect these rich information about our private home is worrisome. However, when we use Data Science to perform these monitoring, the privacy concern is much less dominant (we actually can combine blockchain technology to even record and control which human can view the collected data beyond our AI agents). The voice recognition technology has reached to a point where it surpassed human in dictation recognition rate. This means talking to a machine, one has better chance of being transcribed correctly than talking to a human. When it comes to limited context - in this situation, security related topics, the recognition rate can be even higher. So people can sleep better at night knowing no one around the corner is listening to their snoring (or sleep-talked their password) on the other side of a monitoring phone line. One more socially valuable example is for a senior who lives home alone, if she falls, the AI powered sound monitor should be able to recognize that sound and call for help even if the victim can’t push a button. So leveraging Data Science in sound recognition to modernize this sensor and how data is used, is a big value added revolution in this industry that not only benefit traditional home-monitoring users, but also have broad implications for additional services opportunities. Last, but not least, replacing human monitors who perform these monitoring will significantly lower cost of these systems. This will lower the barrier of adopting such services. Unlike traditional monitoring where additional families signing up cost the monitoring company more human capital, Data Science based approach actual can benefit from more data available, hence it may even be desirable for monitoring companies to offer this service to lower-income neighborhood families free of charge, because the data collected would not cost the company much, but actually can help enhance ML training results. 2.3 Benefiting everyone One feature of this long overdue revolution is that it will benefit everyone - the customer will be able to save on monthly fee, yet receive much more value added service, which means more families will be able to afford such services, think about high crime neighborhoods where many families may have lower-income; the monitoring companies will increase their reach, improve their accuracy, and even some predictive ability to increase responsiveness, and reduce false alarm; the employees of the monitoring companies will stop working night-shifts which known to be a health concern, actually a lot of the employment of the monitoring companies would shift to Data Science, sensor engineer type, high paid jobs. So the long over due revolution in this industry is a great opportunity for everyone, and all the technology needed for such revolution is already available. The real innovative part, is the Data Science models that will be needed to change the monitoring from a “sound” driven approach to a data driven approach. "],
