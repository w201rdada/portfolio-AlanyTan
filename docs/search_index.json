While divorce rate has been steadily dropping in the past couple of decades, the drop was mainly associated with a bigger drop in marriage rate. However, less marriage does not mean there is less relationship, and less divorce rate does not mean less break ups. (bgsu 2016) It has been industry consensus that (romantic) relationship breakdown is only second to loss of family member (more on this later) in its emotional traumatic effect to the victim(s). Human therapists, coaches can be very expensive and also limited in their experience relevant to the victim (previous cases they’ve seen/treated). The traumatic impact on the therapists themselves are also limiting the amount of help they are able to offer everyday. The availability of good and relevant guidance is a big challenge in this area, combined with privacy concerns, lead to most people going through this rely on their family, if not themselves only. 1.2 A data science approach to human relationship. The advancement of technology are commonly associated with undesirable shift in social interaction and structure, what often overlooked was the fact that ability to address such challenges are also presented with the technology advancement. While AI and data science have the tendency of treating people more “like a denominator”, it also gave us the ability to offer help in unprecedented ways. Figure 1.1: [relathionship crisis] One less intuitive area was relationship management. While most news headlines are negative, like “smartphones are ruining your relationship”, there are areas where we see opportunities technology can help human relationships. These includes areas from relationship risk prediction, inspirational content generation, para legal, financial planning help, and AI therapists. We will focus on 2 of these possibilities: Relationship risk prediction, and AI therapist. There are some existing literature with time-series data for Facial Affect Coding, can predict divorce up to 90% of accuracy (John Gottman 2015). This approach can be combined with more innovative data processing that became newly available. For example, from analyzing couple’s Facebook actions and interactions, we can determine people’s personality with higher accuracy than traditional questionnaire (Youyou, Kosinski, and Stillwell 2015). Adding on top of that, personality can be used to predict romantic relationship (Noam Shpencer 2016). Building on top of these ideas, we can leverage similar concept, using people’s online behavior regarding relationship management, for example for a particular user, how many “divorce” related documents they are reading .vs. how many “back together” documents, how long they stay on different documents, NLP on their forum/chat stream for emotion analysis, and the type of service their inquiry, can be used to create a predictive model and used to predict “future of relationship”. Another area of innovation is AI therapist. Back in 1964, one of the very first “chat-bot”, ELIZA was built to be a non-directional psychotherapist (some say it’s a parody). The result was actually pretty amazing, lots of people believed in the therapeutic power of ELIZA which pretty much just re-phrase any questions and ask it back at the user. As the AI technology advances, chat-bot is already at an unprecedented level. Considering the traditional Turing test requires the computer to fool 70% of the human judges that it can imitate human intelligence, we are within striking distance when it comes to specific field intelligent chat-bot that provides therapeutic values. The AI therapist will be built on existing chat-bot platforms with special content of therapeutic session as training data. In a sense of natural language processing and response generating form, it will be first used in education settings, for therapist training. This provides a two way communication process where the AI therapist will offer examples of scenarios for human therapists in training, while human therapists will also catch and correct obvious errors that are generated in the AI chat-bot responses. The second phase would be a limited roll out, where free, or nearly free AI therapist will start to offer treatment sessions to light cases, and recommend more senior human therapist in case of severe cases. As more users using it, more data will be collected, combining with our user behavior tracking and prediction model, we would be able to identify the effectiveness of the AI therapist (i.e. romantic status update, reading more possitive articles instead of “divorce” topics, etc) 1.3 An analysis of our initial results. We have done some market research and focus group study. We found that a lot of the studies in romantic relationship management are available, some of them even proposed certain “prediction” models. However, most of these models require significant amount of human expert intervention, which makes large scale implementation cost-prehibitive. Our plan is to leverage existing studies, and technologies, combine it with data science approach (ie. data collection from modern social media, news feeds, etc, and novel strategies, i.e. offering free gifts for people’s anniversaries, or special dates - so that we get indirect information regarding their relationship). We believe there are a lot of actual work can (and need to) be done in this area. We hope everyone can leave a happier life. Bibliography "],

However, it’s an industry that has generated more frustrations than satisfactions. One user summarized it well “why do I pay hundreds of dollars a year for something to listening on my private life and only works if I didn’t’ forget to turn it on?” In the age of Internet of Things, it’s ironic that most of such monitoring services had sensors installed at customer’s homes, majority of them are still rely on analog human based sound monitoring as its core service offering. While this might reduce false alarms, the cost (each human can only monitor certain number of homes, hence the cost can’t get lower than certain point), privacy concerns (I have had friends who worked in this industry, and boy, does he have stories to tell), and the limited functionality is unbelievably medieval. One biggest issue of this industry as it stands its amplifies inequality. Most of crime laden neighborhoods actually struggle to even put food on the table, so spare hundreds of dollars a year on “hiring someone to monitor your home” is just unaffordable. And this create a barrier between affluent neighborhoods and more crime-affected neighborhoods, which in turn causes a vicious cycle. (#fig:pic_old_monitoring)[Grandpa home monitoring] Some gadget vendors started to sell some “digital” monitoring tools, but instead of using data science to reduce human intervention, these gadgets tend to “let you monitor your own home”. While it may be OK for someone who is able to attend video feeds on their phones, this kind of monitoring is much less feasible for working families who do not have the luxury of watching their own homes whenever their phone beeps. So here come data science to solve a market issue and social issues at the same time. 2.2 How can Data Science reinvent this industry It is not hard to imagine that the home monitoring sensors can be digital sensors, as a matter of fact, lots of them are digital these days. They collect data like door/window open (or even lock), smoke, CO, flood, glass break (more on this one later), light, infra-red motion detection, some of them even have power, communication line fault detection. Each sensor would collect a feature of a data-set, so one of the easiest thing we could have done is by consolidating such sensor readings across large amount of homes, we can use Data Science to find patterns, and may even predict break-ins, i.e. maybe based on location, weather, recent neiborhood incidents, and particular motion, sound pattern, we should be able to not only alert early, but also provide recommendations to home owners, or even law enforcement of which area to focus on (i.e. put more patrol units). While many gadget vendors are selling internet based monitoring systems, with fancy features like video feeds, they omitted Data Science potential of having lots of homes connected (the value of community based security enhancements), and pull data together to be used by a Data Science approach to monitor, even predict incidents. In addition, there are existing technologies that are able to have always-on sound monitoring capability, think of Amazon Echo, or the glass break monitor many home monitoring system offer. We can extend this technology to cover a much wider range of events - in addition to glass break, we shall be able to capture door opening, footsteps (and even tell if this is a family member or a stranger), flood, fire, and we can even combine this with infra-red motion sensors (or even video feeds) to get a very detailed examination of events that is under moniotoring. One big benefit of using Data science to do this is privacy concerns, the level of detail that these technology can collect is paramount, to allow human (usually a stranger) to collect these rich information about our private home is worrisome. However, when we use Data Science to perform these monitoring, the privacy concern is much less dominant (we actually can combine blockchain technology to even record and control which human can view the collected data beyond our AI agents). The voice recognition technology has reached to a point where it surpassed human in dictation recognition rate. This means talking to a machine, one has better chance of being transcribed correctly than talking to a human. When it comes to limited context - in this situation, security related topics, the recognition rate can be even higher. So people can sleep better at night knowing no one around the corner is listening to their snoring (or sleep-talked their password) on the otherside of a monitoring phone line. One more socially valuable example is for a senior who lives home alone, if she falls, the AI powered sound monitor should be able to recognize that sound and call for help even if the victim can’t push a button. So leveraging Data Science in sound recognition to modernize this sensor and how data is used, is a big value added revolution in this industry that not only benefit traditional home-monitoring users, but also have broad implications for additional services opportunities. Last, but not least, replacing human monitors who perform these monitoring will significantly lower cost of these systems. This will lower the barrier of adopting such services. Unlike traditional moniotoring where additional families signing up cost the monitoring company more human capital, Data Science based approach actualy can benefit from more data available, hence it may even be desireable for moniotring companies to offer this service to lower-income neiborhood families free of charge, because the data collected would not cost the company much, but actually can help enhance ML training results. 2.3 Benefiting everyone One feature of this long overdue revolution is that it will benefit everyone - the customer will be able to save on monthly fee, yet receive much more value added service, which means more families will be able to afford such services, think about high crime neighborhoods where many families may have lower-income; the monitoring companies will increase their reach, improve their accuracy, and even some predictive ability to increase responsiveness, and reduce false alarm; the employees of the monitoring companies will stop working night-shifts which known to be a health concern, actually a lot of the employment of the monitoring companies would shift to Data Science, sensor engineer type, high paid jobs. So the long over due revolution in this industry is a great opportunity for everyone, and all the technology needed for such revolution is already available. The real innovative part, is the Data Science models that will be needed to change the monitoring from a “sound” driven approach to a data driven approach. "],
